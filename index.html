                    <p>Social media has revolutionized the way we communicate with each other. While it has made it
                        easier to stay in touch with friends and family, it has also had a significant impact on
                        face-to-face communication. According to a study by the University of California, Los Angeles,
                        people who spend more time on social media have less face-to-face contact with others1. This can
                        lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can have a negative impact on mental health.

                    <p>Social media has been linked to a range of psychological effects, both positive and negative. On
                        the positive side, social media can help people feel more connected to others, increase
                        self-esteem, and improve a sense of belonging2. However, excessive use of social media can lead
                        to stress, pressure to compare oneself to others, and increased sadness and isolation2. Research
                        has shown that excessive use of social media is associated with lower psychological well-being2.

                    <p>Social media can have both positive and negative influences on mental health. On the positive
                        side, social media can provide opportunities to enhance the mental health of users by
                        facilitating social connections and peer support2. Online communities can provide a space for
                        discussions regarding health conditions, adverse life events, or everyday challenges, which may
                        decrease the sense of stigmatization and increase belongingness and perceived emotional
                        support2. On the other hand, several studies have pointed out the potentially detrimental
                        effects of social media use on mental health. Concerns have been raised that social media may
                        lead to body image dissatisfaction, increase the risk of addiction and cyberbullying
                        involvement, contribute to phubbing behaviors, and negatively affect mood23. Excessive use has
                        increased loneliness, fear of missing out, and decreased subjective well-being and life
                        satisfaction231. Users at risk of social media addiction often report depressive symptoms and
                        lower self-esteem</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, social media has both positive and negative effects on face-to-face communication and mental
                health. It is important to use social media mindfully and in moderation to avoid the negative effects
                associated with excessive use.
